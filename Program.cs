				//1-Create IVehicle interface with two methods, one for Drive of type void and another for Refuel of type bool that has a parameter of type integer with the amount of gasoline to refuel.
				//2-Then create a Car class with a constructor that receives a parameter with the car's starting gasoline amount and implements the Drive and Refuel methods of the car.
				//3-The Drive method will print on the screen that the car is Driving, if the gasoline is greater than 0. 
				//4-The Refuel method will increase the gasoline of the car and return true.
				//5-Create IDrivable interface that has 3 methods, one for Move of type void and one for Accelerate of type void and one for Drive of type void.
				//6-Make class Car implement IDrivable.
				//a.Can class Car implement more than one Interface?
				//b.Try implementing the interfaces explicitly and implicitly.
